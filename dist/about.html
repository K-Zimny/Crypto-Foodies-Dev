The Foundation is community-driven and is tasked to oversee the development of the virtual restaurant ecosystem, provide meaningful interactions between creators and host restaurants, and create the rules, rewards, and responsibilities of the $CFood token. The Company receives Virtual Restaurants (VRs) from the foundation to package them into NFTs for lease on its trading platform. Once the leaseholder of the NFT receives the brand, they either, launch the brand in their physical location via 3rd party delivery apps or launch the brand in the metaverse with fulfillment coming from Host Restaurants (HR) in their area.</p></div></div></section></body></html>
