Our goal is to unite independent and franchise restaurants across the world into one decentralized restaurant group. The community can then come together to purchase existing or up-and-coming brands and convert them into virtual-only concepts for our outpost locations.</p><p class="serif">All brands that license with Meal Outpost are also signing up for our loyalty NFT card. At certain thresholds, MO will push rewards, discounts, or our $CFood tokens to be used in stores across the world for our consumers and community members.</p></div></section><hr class="innerpage-divider"/><section class="solid-bg"><div class="sm-container"><h2 class="large">Why</h2><p class="serif">If you want to start a restaurant you have two choices: start it yourself, or get a franchise. Starting yourself means you face a stark reality: nearly 90% of restaurants fail. Getting a franchise is safer, but also means most of your revenue is split between middlemen and corporations, leaving the franchisee not as an owner but an employee of the brand. (On average, making $82,000 a year.)</p><div><p class="serif"><strong>We believe restaurant operators need four major tools in the post-pandemic economy:</strong></p><ol><li class="serif">Access to virtual brands which only live in digital apps.</li><li class="serif">Raw ingredients and last mile economies of scale.</li><li class="serif">Complete kitchen monetization and utilization.</li><li class="serif">Marketing support</li></ol><div><p class="serif"><strong>We believe restaurant brands need three major tools:</strong></p><ol><li class="serif">A path to scale without having to pay the costs to franchise.</li><li class="serif">Stability in Labor</li><li class="serif">Marketing support</li></ol></div></div></div></section><hr class="innerpage-divider"/><section class="solid-bg"><div class="sm-container"><h2 class="large">Who</h2><p class="serif">The core team has over 50 years experience in the food industry and over 10 years of experience in virtual kitchens.</p><div><p class="serif">The community exists for individuals/groups who:</p><ul><li class="serif">Develop a concept that the community can turn into a brand.

Owners select our Virtual Restaurants, they operate them at their restaurants, and then they remit 40% royalty fee to Meal Outpost. We use this royalty to burn the $Meal token, airdrop rewards to community participants, and purchase traditional brands to convert into more virtual restaurants.</p><p class="serif">Our model is built upon a decentralized system which allows for the best brands to receive funding and the opportunity to scale unlike any other licensing or franchise system. Think of Meal Outpost and its $Meal token as a restaurant ETF; instead of investing in one particular brand, you are investing in the constellation of brands that operate on our platform.</p><p class="serif">Meal Outpost is split between two entities, the Restaurant DAO and Meal Outpost. The Restaurant DAO is tasked to oversee the development of the virtual restaurant ecosystem and provides a place for creators and host restaurants to create the rules and responsibilities of the $Meal token. The community votes on every brand that will be a part of Meal Outpost to ensure community support for the brand. The company receives the virtual restaurants from the DAO and partners with suppliers, delivery partners, and regulators to ensure consistency and infrastructure across the brands. Royalties from the actual purchases are split back between the community chest (DAO) and the company to cover overhead. The company is necessary because it is the only entity that can currently purchase assets on behalf of the DAO.</p></div></section><hr class="innerpage-divider"/><section id="roadmapBlock" class="solid-bg"><p>Roadmap</p></section><section class="solid-bg"><div class="sm-container"><h2 class="large">When</h2><p class="serif">Starting Q1 2022, Meal Outpost will operate a local restaurant (Pint Pub) in the Wicker Park neighborhood in Chicago.

We can go to suppliers, 3DSP, and negotiate better rates. Large companies are paying DSP 12-17% for delivery while independent restaurants are paying 25-30%. Why? Because they don’t have power within the ecosystem, it is all slanted towards the big franchise corporations.</p></div><div><p class="serif"><strong>Whats the value of the food creator or brand joining a collective?</strong></p><p class="serif">Support. When you start a new business you don’t know what you don’t know. Designing menus, logos, finding suppliers, is time consuming and expensive. A collective will help you leap frog over hurdles and give feedback on whether your idea is likely to succeed at scale or not.</p></div></div></section></div></div><video autoplay loop muted playsinline id="aboutPageVideo"><source src="../4522c566bc718162.mp4"/></video><section id="accessibility"><div><button><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="far" data-icon="eye-slash" class="svg-inline--fa fa-eye-slash fa-w-20" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 640 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M634 471L36 3.51A16 16 0 0 0 13.51 6l-10 12.49A16 16 0 0 0 6 41l598 467.49a16 16 0 0 0 22.49-2.49l10-12.49A16 16 0 0 0 634 471zM296.79 146.47l134.79 105.38C429.36 191.91 380.48 144 320 144a112.26 112.26 0 0 0-23.21 2.47zm46.42 219.07L208.42 260.16C210.65 320.09 259.53 368 320 368a113 113 0 0 0 23.21-2.46zM320 112c98.65 0 189.09 55 237.93 144a285.53 285.53 0 0 1-44 60.2l37.74 29.5a333.7 333.7 0 0 0 52.9-75.11 32.35 32.35 0 0 0 0-29.19C550.29 135.59 442.93 64 320 64c-36.7 0-71.71 7-104.63 18.81l46.41 36.29c18.94-4.3 38.34-7.1 58.22-7.1zm0 288c-98.65 0-189.08-55-237.93-144a285.47 285.47 0 0 1 44.05-60.19l-37.74-29.5a333.6 333.6 0 0 0-52.89 75.1 32.35 32.35 0 0 0 0 29.19C89.72 376.41 197.08 448 320 448c36.7 0 71.71-7.05 104.63-18.81l-46.41-36.28C359.28 397.2 339.89 400 320 400z"></path></svg></button></div></section></main><footer><div class="texture-1"><div class="container"><div><p>© <span id="copyrightFooterYear"></span> Meal Outpost</p></div><ul><li><a href="https://discord.gg/z3AKdeDXXY"><figure><img src="../assets/images/cbce02859ce1097d.svg" alt="Discord Logo."/></figure></a></li></ul></div></div><div id="subFooter"><div class="container"><ul><li><a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/terms-conditions">Terms & Conditions</a></li><li><a href="https://www.tractatusdesign.studio/">Design + Development by Tractatus Design Studio</a></li></ul></div></div></footer></body></html>
